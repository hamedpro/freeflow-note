<h1>🧑‍💻 🖥️ setting dev environment</h1>

> this instruction is meant to be used in mac or common linux distros. almost sure will not work in windows. 

all you need is to clone the repo then install npm dependencies using: 

```
npm install ; 
``` 
application data is saved in 🗂️ `~/.freeflow_data` <br />
application data means all env vars and uploaded files and every tranasction that will be created in application. `it simply means everything.` application will not use anywhere else in the disk even its repository dir itself. <br />
so there are a few 🖥️ ⚙️ bash scripts in root of repo to help you get thing done ⚡️ quickly.

```
./init_data_dir.bash // creates a .freeflow_data and required all dirs and files. fills them with initial values. for env vars it creates env.json and fills it with a template and opens vi to customize it. after changes wq the vi and all is done.

./reset_but_env.bash // it resets everything inside data dir to their initial values but env.json
```

finally when you created data dir, you can use any of npm scripts : 

```
npm start ; //for production 
npm run dev ; //to start development mode 
```

<b>you're good to go !</b>

there are a few error patterns we may forget during development.
list of them is always kept in `stablility_tests.txt`
