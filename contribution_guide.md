the best way is to help us improve the code. adding features and new grown ideas, testing and fixing bugs, refactoring and improving codes, etc...

`there are always a lot of different issues open.` but dont directly start working on them. at this very moment there are 6 open projects and we're working on the first one. pick something from it. workflow is like this : 
1. 📋 `Backlog` : an idea is turned to an issue but its not finalized to be done in that way. after thinking enough it will go to "Ready" column.
2. 🙂 `Ready` : contains issues finalized to be done.
3. 🏗️ `functionality in progress` : if project has frontend or backend label, those parts must be done here. it doesn't need to be pretty or perfect in terms of UX. it must only work.
4. 👩‍🎨`Design in progress `: if that issue has Design label that must be done here.
5. 👀 🧪 `Review` : its where we test to see if everything is as expected or not.
6. 👏 `Done` : hoora! everything is done.
